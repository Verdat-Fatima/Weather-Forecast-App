# Weather-Forecast-App
This repository contains a Python-based Weather Forecast Application that allows users to get real-time weather information for any city in the world using the OpenWeatherMap API. The program provides essential weather details such as temperature, “feels like” temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure, and a short description of current weather conditions. It also intelligently converts the city’s timezone data into the correct local time and displays it live. The script includes proper error handling for issues like invalid API keys, network errors, city not found, or exceeding API request limits, making it reliable and user-friendly. To use the program, users only need to replace the placeholder text 'Place your API key' with their own free OpenWeatherMap API key. The project currently runs in the terminal but will be expanded in the future with a graphical user interface (GUI), additional features like sunrise/sunset times, wind speed, weather icons, and improved user interaction. This repository is ideal for beginners learning API integration in Python and for anyone interested in creating real-time data applications.
